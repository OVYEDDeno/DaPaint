              Our mission at Bento is to help bring more creator-led businesses,
              projects, and creativity to the world. We believe to be at the
              cusp of a huge creative revolution - creators should now focus on
              creating something they care about. We help them focus on their
              audience and ensure that making a living online becomes easier and
              more delightful. Our vision is simple: we believe that the
              inspiration and collaboration from people sharing their work will
              lead to greater ideas and creations that will help the world move
              forward. A Bento is a place for inspiration, engagement, and
              meaningfully connecting with peers. Itâ€™s a place that helps bring
              the right minds together and spark innovation! Wanna help the
              mission? Join the ride!
